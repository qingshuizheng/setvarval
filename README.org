#+title: VarExt - Variable Extraction


* Why
Too often, when we are faced with a new package, one way to explore it is to extract the variables (defcustom/defvar/defconst/defface) one by one. This package saves you some time.

There might be some better packages to do it, but this is my own.

* Example
This is what it looks like after extraction from Emacs builtin =simple.el=. It is truncated due to long list, and it is the reason this package exists.):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq idle-update-delay 0.5)
(setq next-error-highlight 0.5)
(setq next-error-highlight-no-select 0.5)
(setq next-error-recenter nil)
(setq next-error-message-highlight nil)
(setq next-error-hook nil)
(setq next-error-verbose t)
(setq next-error-find-buffer-function #'ignore)
(setq next-error-found-function #'ignore)
(setq delete-trailing-lines t)
(setq read-quoted-char-radix 8)
(setq cycle-spacing-actions '(just-one-space delete-all-space restore))
(setq delete-active-region t)
(setq goto-line-history-local nil)
.

more and more and more going on...

* Installation

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package varext
  :straight (:host "github" :repo "qingshuizheng/varext")
  :config
  (setq varext-type 'defcustom) ; 'defvar, 'defconst, 'defface
  (setq varext-setter 'setq)    ; 'setopt
  )
#+end_src

* Usage
1. (optional) =M-x varext-setting RET= to choose which type of variable to collect and which setter to use after collecting.
2. Go to the package buffer and =M-x varext-extract RET=, variables are saved to kill-ring.
